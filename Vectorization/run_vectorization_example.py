# First, let's define vectorizers for all the options we have discussed:
# CountVectorizer, TfidfVectorizer, DictionaryVectorizer.
# 
# I'm not using scikit-learn's versions because I prefer to implement some
#Â custom functionality directly from scratch (scikit-learn's vectorizers could
# also be extended accordingly, though), notice the `group_by_class` parameter.
