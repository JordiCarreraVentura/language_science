    "\n",
    "1. _Is $p_i$ a probability?_\n",
    "\n",
    "   No, it is not. While it is expressed as a polarity, it is actually just a ratio and it corresponds to $$n_c / |N| = n_c / |\\forall_{c' \\in C}^{C}\\ n_{c'}|,$$ or the number of elements in each class $c$ divided over the total number of elements (for any class). Essentially, it tells us which fraction of a dataset (or subset thereof) belongs to each class.\n",
    "2. _Why do we use the **unary negation** to reverse the polarity?_\n",
    "\n",
    "   Because the logarithm inside the summation yields negative numbers, yet the entropy is defined as a positive magnitude (a concave function that we intend to maximize, insofar as we are measuring the presence of something). To get a positive measurament (corresponding to the presence of something) on the basis of negative values (typically associated with the absence of something), we need to reverse their polarity. And we cannot just add some other value to it because that would effectively cancel them out.\n",
    "4. _Why do we use the logarithm?_\n",
    "\n",
    "   It provides re-scaling of a fraction that is beyond normalization and, in that way, reinstates a sense of an absolute value. Fractions are relative and will always add up to $1.0$, which would be ambiguous between all possible distributions of the classes (all combinations of fractional numbers add up to $1.0$ when expressing probabilities or ratios).\n",
    "\n",
    "   In contrast, $log(1/2) \\approx -0.3$ and $log(1/4) \\approx -0.6$. Hence, assuming $n = |2|$ and $n = |4|$, respectively (under the uniformity assumption), the sum of their entropies is $-0.6$ and $-2.4$, despite the fact that the sum of the ratios themselves would still be $1.0$ and $1.0$, and non-differentiable. **The logarithm makes these ratios differentiable**, still as a function of their **original proportion** as ratios, while also magnifying the result for smaller ratios because, by the definition of entropy, **lower ratios represent a lower expectation** and must therefore be assigned a higher entropy. The (negative) logarithm over-represents smaller values because, for a small ratio, it is orders of magnitude greater than the ratio itself, e.g."

Hence, we can have classes with a very low ratio and, as a result, extremely high information, yet they are so rare that their total contribution to the entropy could still be low. The highest entropies will normally be measured over ratios that are low yet still significant (closer to the random baseline, or $1 / |C|$).\n",
